### Notes

- The level number, seed, and code are calculated based on the algorithm as it
  appears in the disassembled game code.
- All other level trait data has been extracted directly from the file
  `level.dat`. This file only covers levels 0 to 494, and the set of traits
  changes every 5 levels. Codes 495 to 1,000 will work, but operate unusually,
  drawing their traits from the last map code entered.
- Level 0 is also called GENESIS.
- The letters ESKVFA stand for Earthquake, Swamp, Knight, Volcano, Flood, and
  Armageddon. Armageddon doesn't show up on the level screen, but it's in there.
- For more information, see [Level format](../analysis/level-format.html).
- This list presents two major corrections from Kenneth Fuchs' manually produced
  [PopulousKeys](https://aminet.net/package/game/hint/PopulousKeys)
  list from Fish Disk 531:
  - Levels 325 to 329 (SCODEING, SWADIORD, KILLWILCON, EOAINGILL, BURIHILL)
    are Snow and Ice, not Grassy Plane.
  - Levels 335 to 339 (ALPUSILL, BADDIETORY, IMMQUEEND, HOBUED, BUGDEHAM)
    are Desert, not Grassy Plane.
