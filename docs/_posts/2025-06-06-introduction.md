_Populous_ is a strategy game originally released for the Commodore Amiga
platform in March 1989 by Peter Molyneux's company Bullfrog Productions. It is
the first "god game," a genre in which the player indirectly controls simulated
beings by manipulating their environment, rather than by controlling units
directly.

### This project

This webpage is a reverse-engineering project which seeks to disassemble and
analyze the game in order to learn how it works and document its various opaque
mechanics.

Disassembly is done using [Aira Force](https://howprice.itch.io/aira-force),
howprice's excellent graphical front-end for the
[ira](https://aminet.net/package/dev/asm/ira) command-line disassembler, for
whom we must credit Tim Ruehsen, Frank Wille and Nicolas Bastien. The
[FS-UAE](https://fs-uae.net/) emulator by Frode Solheim et al has also been
vital to the project.
