# Populous disassembled source code

This directory contains disassembled representations of the main game excutables
in _Populous_.

The file "populous_main" is from the game launch executable "populous", while
"populous_prg" is from the main game executable "populous.prg". Each ".asm" file
is a representation of the in assembly language, while each ".cnf" file is a
config which can be fed into
[ira disassembler](https://aminet.net/package/dev/asm/ira) (or the ira-based GUI
[Aira Force](https://howprice.itch.io/aira-force)) to reproduce the respective
".asm" files.

The disassembly comes from the Hit Squad 1993 budget re-release of the game,
uncracked. This was chosen as it lacks most of the obfuscation present in the
original release, which made it hard to analyze. The config files will only work
for this version.

Disassembly of this game is believed to constitute fair use for the purposes of
analysis and commentary. You still need an original copy of the game in order to
play it.
